                      Can future furniture be as a part of a smart home?

                      PRETEXT
                      The website touted the benefits of the new smart furniture: “Sofia pairs with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth technology and cable TV to enable couch-based, voice-enabled access to a wide range of mobile, IoT and other ‘smart’ devices in the home.”

In the end, the whole thing turned out to be an elaborate prank for April Fool’s Day. But actually, the concept of smart furniture is no longer a joke.


                      
                    
                      Smart Home is on everyone's lips - but so far there has been little talk of intelligent furniture. This will change, of course, because thanks to digitalization, tables, sofas and the like can also offer added value. In this blog post you can read about the challenges facing furniture manufacturers and what Smart Furniture looks like in concrete terms.

                      Smart Home is no longer a buzzword but a reality. Intelligent lights, networked fire detectors or web-connected surveillance cameras are even available at food discounters. Although many of us have concerns about privacy and security, a recent Deloitte study shows that the spread of smart home components continues to increase including furniture elements.

                      That, at least, is the utopian version of the smart home that exists 10 years out. Swedish research firm Berg Insight says 63 million American homes will qualify as “smart” by 2022. But a decade from now, experts say, we’ll move from turning the lights on and off with our voices to total immersion in the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence, the smartest homes will be able to truly learn about their owners or occupants, eventually anticipating their needs. Developments in robotics will give us machines that offer a helping hand with cleaning, cooking and more. New sensors will keep tabs on our well-being. Central to all of this will be the data that smart homes collect, analyze and act upon, helping to turn the houses of the future from a mere collection of gadgets and accessories into truly “smart” homes.

                      In the recent years the habits of buying furniture have changed. The fabrication of individual pieces of furniture is increasingly coming to the forefront. A personal contact is being established between the customer and the furniture, which is a relationship of one (product) to one (customer). In order to satisfy the indi-vidual demands, higher quality as well as higher prices appeared as a necessity.






                      Function can be expressed as the properties re-lated to the use of a product. These properties include the relation between a product and a consumer (Antal, 2007).On the basis of purchasing motivation, the sys-tem of functions can be divided into: - functionality (e.g. utility and practical function) and- aesthetic functions (e.g. visual sensation, emotions).Aesthetic value is considered to be the effect (or style) of objects as to what degree they can teach us to perceive or understand the appeal of beauty  (Eco, 2004). Nevertheless a designed object, such as a piece of furniture, can be evaluated regarding whether beau-ty is involved in it, or not.

                    The competition is beginning on the market, where emotion becomes a significant factor in decision-making process. Therefore, functionality and aesthetic functions, determinative forms and fashionable style play a very important role in furniture design and production. The objective of the paper is to report research results on how functionality and aesthetics of different styles of furniture could be determinated, measured and how they influence customer requirements and demands. To establish the proportion of functionality and aesthetic features, a numerical expression of the functions was defined by using various designers’ methods such as Ranking Method Quality Development (RMQD) and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). It is shown that both methods could be used very effectively for designed and marketing oriented furniture, for modelling customer satisfaction as well as in connection with aesthetic functions, assuring the quality of the product in the planning stage.

                      You may have heard of performance fabrics in the context of activewear, but performance fabrics don't only belong at the gym. Performance fabrics also have an important place in your home — and we don't just mean on the back patio. For decades, indoor/outdoor fabrics have been featured on decks, patios and poolsides, but now, performance fabrics are becoming increasingly popular for use inside the home.






                      Performance fabrics are more durable than other fabrics. Typically, this means they are water-resistant, aren't likely to stain and are easy to clean. Performance fabrics are sometimes made from materials that naturally possess these qualities, but often, they are made from materials that wouldn't be quite so strong on their own then are treated to enhance their performance.

                      Some performance fabrics will be composed of a combination of fibers. For the 2021 Summer season as well as for 2022 Winter, we would like to
                    introduce you to our brand new fabrics. Rate, Bouclè and Silent.
                    These 3 carefully selected fabrics are perfectly suitable for the
                    coming seasons. We selected a variety of matching colors, which
                    will result in beautiful furniture for every household.

                    Upholstered furniture receives varying degrees of use depending on the type of piece and where it's located. No matter how upholstery is used in your home, it's important that the fabric stands up well to its usual level of use. For example, sofas, chairs, and ottomans receiving only moderate amounts of wear, such as those in bedrooms or more formal spaces, will do fine with a less durable fabric. However, pieces subjected to daily heavy wear, like the family room sofa, need to be covered in tough, durable, tightly woven fabrics to protect against stains and damage.

When purchasing upholstery fabric or upholstered furniture, be aware that the higher the thread count, the more tightly woven the fabric is and the better it will wear. Thread count refers to the number of threads per square inch of fabric. Use this guide to natural and synthetic materials to help you find the best upholstery fabric for your next furniture project.
